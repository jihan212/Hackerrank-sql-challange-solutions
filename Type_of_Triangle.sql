/*
Write a query identifying the type of each record in the TRIANGLES table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

Equilateral: It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.
Isosceles: It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.
Scalene: It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lengths.
Not A Triangle: The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.
*/

SELECT CASE
WHEN A + B <= C OR A + C <= B OR B + C <= A THEN 'Not A Triangle'
WHEN A = B AND B = C THEN 'Equilateral'
WHEN A = B OR B = C OR A = C THEN 'Isosceles'
ELSE 'Scalene'
END
FROM TRIANGLES;

/*
The CASE expression goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an if-then-else statement). So, once a condition is true, it will stop reading and return the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in the ELSE clause.

If there is no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it returns NULL.
